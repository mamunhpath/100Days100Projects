## Purpose

100 Days - 100 Projects it's a challenge that's meant to help you improve your coding skills by creating projects (lots of them :smiley:).

There are also three other variants you might want to try
- **#7Days7Projects** - the easy one
- **#30Days30Projects** - the middle one
- **#365Days365Projects** - the Ultimate Challenge

You can find the detailed information about the Challenge [on my blog](https://florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/100-days-100-projects).

In this repository you'll be able to propose new projects by creating an issue for each of them.

Here is all project listing on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/full/VwYWMOa).

Have fun! :innocent:
